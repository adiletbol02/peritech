## Usage

**Users:**
Navigate to the main page to browse products.
Use the filters and sorting options to refine your search.
Add products to your cart and proceed to checkout to place an order.
View your past orders and their current statuses in your profile.

**Admins:**
Log in with the admin credentials (the first admin is seeded automatically; default credentials: admin@example.com / admin123).
Access the Admin Dashboard Hub via the link in the navbar.
From the hub, view detailed sales trends, manage the product catalog (add, edit, delete), view and delete all orders, and manage user roles.

## Additional Notes

**Security:**
Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. For production use, ensure you use secure session management and HTTPS.

**Order Integrity:**
Orders store a snapshot of product details (name, price) to ensure historical accuracy even if products are later deleted.

**Customization:**
The sales trends dashboard is highly customizable via query parameters (e.g., date range, view type, best-selling product inclusion).
